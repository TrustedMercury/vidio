## what is vidio?
vidio is a new discord bot that allows you to create a simulation of a YouTube Channel on Discord! It's a simulation game that allows you to manage your very own virtual youtube channel! Upload videos, earn money and find your way through the leaderboard!

## how do I get started?
to start your youtube simulation journey, you need to first create a channel. You can do that with ``create_channel``. Read the prompts and enter your channel name, description and category. Once you've created your channel, you're ready to go! Note: You can create a maximum of 3 channels.

## uploading videos
you can upload videos on a channel once an hour. Use ``upload`` to upload a video. Follow the prompts and then the bot is going to send an embed showing you how your video did! Note: the statistics(subscribers, views, likes, dislikes, money) of your video will continue changing for the next 5 days.

## other commands
now, as you've got a hang on the basics of operating vidio! Before you go around streaming, here are a few fun commands you should know about -  
• ``help`` - Shows you a list of all the commands that you can use.  
• ``channel`` - Shows you information about your channel.  
• ``profile`` - Shows you information about your **vidio** account.
